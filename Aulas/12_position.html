    <p>Trigg's house was one-story tall, so there was nowhere to escape. He took shelter 
        on the second floor of his neighbor's house and waited as the water kept rising. 
        As it got dark, he could hear people screaming for help. He wondered if he would 
        survive the night. "I did a lot of praying that night," he says. "Not so much for 
        myself, but for the people I could hear." </p>

    <p>Trigg was rescued by boat the next morning. The home he and his wife lived in was 
        destroyed, as were almost all of the other homes on their block. In all, at least 
        23 people died in the 2016 West Virginia floods, and an estimated 1,500 homes and 
        businesses were ruined. </p>

    <p>Rainelle is one of hundreds of small towns where climate-driven flooding potentially 
        poses an existential threat. Sea level rise and heavier rainstorms driven by global 
        warming are sending more water into residential neighborhoods from the Gulf Coast to 
        New England to Appalachia to the Pacific Northwest. And new data make it clear that many 
        households and communities cannot afford the mounting costs. </p>

    <p>More than 4 million houses and small apartment buildings across the contiguous U.S. have 
        substantial risk of expensive flood damage, according to data released by the First Street 
        Foundation, a nonprofit research organization that studies flood risk and housing. The cost 
        of flood damage to homes nationwide will increase by more than 50% in the next 30 years, the 
        First Street Foundation estimates. </p>
