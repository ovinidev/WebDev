    <p>The slinky predator named <b>Elizabeth Ann</b>, born Dec. 10 and announced 
        Thursday, is cute as a button. But watch out — unlike the domestic ferret 
        foster mom who carried, her into the <em>world</em>, she’s wild at heart.</p>

        “You might have been handling a black-footed ferret kit and then they try to 
        take your finger <a href="">fake link</a> off the next day,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service black-footed 
        ferret recovery coordinator Pete Gober said Thursday. “She’s holding her own.”

        “Biotechnology and genomic data can really make a difference on the ground with conservation efforts,” said 
        Ben Novak, lead scientist with Revive & Restore, a biotechnology-focused conservation nonprofit that coordinated 
        the ferret and horse clonings.
